# GraphButton

A circuit that posts to the Open Graph 

[![Graphbutton Tutorial](http://i.imgur.com/ItsjKdY.png)](http://www.lifegraphlabs.com/how-to)

**What youâ€™ll learn:** How to create a circuit that posts an action to your profile on the Open Graph with a WiFly module.

**What you'll need:**
* [A WiFly Module](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10822) ($35)
* [An Arduino](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11021) ($30)
* A switch or some wire
* A resistor (~10k ohms)

## Prerequisites

Completed the [hardware tutorial](https://github.com/lifegraph/hw-tutorial) and have a set up Arduino that can talk to the internet. 

## Set up your Arduino & WiFly module

The Arduino and WiFly shield should already be set up from the [hardware tutorial](https://github.com/lifegraph/hw-tutorial).

For more questions regarding getting started with Arduino, such as the Arduino IDE, how to use libraries in Arduino, etc. refer to http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage.

## Adding the Button

You'll need to connect a button between digital pin 12 and ground on the Arduino as well. Pushing down this button will make the Arduino post to Facebook. 

We'll also add a pull up resistor between pin 12 and +5v, otherwise the pin might read 0 at random times. The general recommended resistance is around 10k but it'll work with other resistances as well. You just don't want a resistance that is too low (<100 ohms) or else it'll short between Vcc and Ground.

## Making HTTP Requests

We'll be using [WiFlyHQ](https://github.com/harlequin-tech/WiFlyHQ) as our library for interfacing with the WiFly module. The setup of the library is covered in the [hardware tutorial](https://github.com/lifegraph/hw-tutorial).

We'll also be using the [Lifegraph Arduino library](https://github.com/lifegraph/arduino-lifegraph) along with the WiFlyHQ library. The Lifegraph library allows us to easily use Facebook's API without having to worry about properly formatting HTTP requests ourselves. The library also gives us a way to process the data that Facebook sends back to us.

In order to install the library, you'll need to:

1. [download the zip file here](https://github.com/lifegraph/arduino-lifegraph/archive/master.zip)
2. Unzip the file
3. Rename the folder from arduino-lifegraph-master to Lifegraph
4. Put the folder where the rest of your Arduino libraries are. This is probably underneath `~/Documents/Arduino/libraries`
5. Restart the Arduino IDE

Now open the Arduino IDE and you should see the Lifegraph library as an option when you go to Sketch -> Import Library

## The Arduino code

Then open up `graphbutton.ino` from the [graphbutton example in this repo](https://github.com/lifegraph/graphbutton-wifly/blob/master/graphbutton/graphbutton.ino). You'll need to change the network name and the password 

```ino
const char mySSID[] = "your_ssid";
const char myPassword[] = "your_password";
```

## Authentication with Facebook

We'll also need an authentication token from Facebook in order to get the right notification information. For a temporary access token, follow the 1 hour auth instructions. There's also a Facebook proxy at [lifegraphconnect.com](http://www.lifegraphconnect.com) that will allow you to have 2 month tokens.

### 1 hour authentication

1. Go to the Graph API Explorer: [https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer) and request a token.
![get token](https://raw.github.com/lifegraph/notificationlight/master/imgs/get_token.png)
2. ask for "manage_notifications" permissions.
3. copy that auth token
4. These tokens only work for 1 hour so they should only be used for testing.

### 2 month authentication

1. Go to [lifegraphconnect.com](http://www.lifegraphconnect.com) and log in
2. Find the Graph Button tutorial and allow access to it. The app needs your permission to post on Facebook in order to work.
3. Click on the "View Token" button to view your auth token
4. Copy the auth token

## Setting up your auth token

After you get your access token, you'll need to stick it in the `graphbutton.ino` as well:

```ino
const char access_token[] = "...";
```

Save the code and then load it up onto an Arduino.
